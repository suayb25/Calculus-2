Calculus 2 for Computer Science Ph.D. Students

These Jupyter Notebooks (via Google Colab) are adapted from a YouTube video (https://youtu.be/7gigNsz4Oe8)

This course was created by Dr. Linda Green, a lecturer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I am just studying her course in a computer engineer way with Python programming language.
